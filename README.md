# node-js-laptop-store

This simple dynamic website is made with node.js. It allows you to easily add new products to the overview page, then dynamically making a new url path to them and constructing the product page.

This was from the course "The Complete Javascript Course 2020: Build Real Projects" By Jonas Schmedtmann
